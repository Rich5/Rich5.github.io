**Harness**

Harness is remote access payload with the ability to provide a remote interactive PowerShell interface from a Windows system to virtually any TCP socket. The primary goal of the Harness Project is to provide a remote interface with the same capabilities and overall feel of the native PowerShell executable bundled with the Windows OS.

Payload Features:

  * Remote PowerShell CLI
  * Multiline command processing similar to native PowerShell.exe
  * Supports remote importing of PowerShell modules without additional staging (requires supporting handler)
  * Unmanaged payload allows for white list bypassing
  * Reflective payload allows for payload to be injected into other processes
