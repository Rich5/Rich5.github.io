This is a blog that that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike a security blog. I specialize in information security so most of the posts here will likely be about that, but you&#8217;re also equally as likely to find a good rant from time-to-time or something relating to my other various interests. If you&#8217;re interested in penetration testing, programming, science, politics, or just like a good diatribe stick around.
